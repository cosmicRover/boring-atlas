From the invention of writing systems to the landing of rovers on Mars, human history is full of events both positive and negative, that define us as a species! Traditionally, we learn about these events through textbooks and online mediums in the form of a summary or long detail-rich articles. While these mediums are informationally rich, these traditional methods of learning may not be as effective for todayâ€™s learners.
